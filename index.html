          <em class="pFortnite">Fortnite</em> is an online video game and game
          platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available
          in seven distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same
          general gameplay and game engine

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          <em class="pFortnite">Fortnite</em> began from an internal game jam at
          Epic Games following the publishing of Gears of War 3 around 2011.
          Though it was not initially one of the developed titles during the
          jam, the concept of merging the construction game genre, representing
          games like Minecraft and Terraria, and shooter games arose, leading to
          the foundation of Fortnite. Development of Fortnite slowed due to
          several issues, including switching from the Unreal Engine 3 to Unreal
          Engine 4, a deeper role-playing game approach to extend the life of
          the game, and a switch of art style from a dark theme to a more
          cartoonish style. Further, Epic was looking to get into the games as a
          service model, and brought in Chinese publisher Tencent to help;
          Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the
          departure of several executives, including Cliff Bleszinski, who had
          been a key part of Fortnite's development. Fortnite's approach was
          changed to be Epic's testbed for games as a service, and further
          slowed the development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Epic was able to prepare to release Fortnite as a paid early access
          title in July 2017, with plans to release it as free-to-play sometime
          in 2019 while gaining feedback from players to improve the game. With
          the release of Fortnite Battle Royale, the player-versus-environment
          mode was distinguished as "Save the World". Ultimately, Epic opted to
          release Save the World as a premium title, bringing it out of early
          access on June 29, 2020.
